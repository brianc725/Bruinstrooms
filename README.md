# Bruinstrooms

## Description

An Android application allowing users to rate restrooms at UCLA along with
post reviews for others to see. Users will also be able to view restroom
amentities such as handicap accessibility, number of sinks, mirrors, etc.
In the event of emergency such as clogged toilet or facuet that won't turn off,
users will be able to send emergency alerts to those viewing the restroom or
even to maintenance for repair. 

The frontend was created in Android Studio and backend utilized Firebase.

We are looking to expand functionality to include geolocation for finding
restrooms nearest you.
